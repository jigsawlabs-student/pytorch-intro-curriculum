    "Why learn about neural networks?  Neural networks allow us to process information that, previously, was largely beyond the grasp of a computer.  For example, neural networks are used to identify images, summarize handwritten text and create transcripts of audio files.  So with neural networks, we can take things that we may not previously have thought of as data, like an image and text, and feed it into for a computer to interpret.\n",
